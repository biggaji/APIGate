# APIGate
An API Gateway implementation.

## Definition:
An API gateway is an API management tool that sits between a client and a collection of backend services. An API gateway acts as a reverse proxy to accept all application programming interface (API) calls, aggregate the various services required to fulfill them, and return the appropriate result.

## Development
I'm building mine from scratch. It will support:
- Caching
- Authentication & Authorization
- Rate limiting
- Logging
- It uses a custom config file: `gate-config.yml`

Will update this README file when it's ready to roll out!

Thank you.
